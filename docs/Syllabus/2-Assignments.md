# Assignments

## Weekly Memos
For each week's readings, students will write a response paper in the form of a [[Resources/how to write a precis and memo|research memo]]. The goal of the memo is to synthesize in one or two pages the argument of the work, placing it within the larger context of the semester and the literature.

## Weekly Discussion
We will meet weekly to discuss the reading.

## Final Paper
Students will write a final paper of roughly 4000-6000 words on a topic to be determined in discussion with me. This can go many directions-- 1. a literature review on an issue, theme, event of interest in Latin America, analyzed through an historical materialist lens; 2. a theoretical paper; 3. an intellectual history; etc.
